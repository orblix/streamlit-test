Visibility over data flows is an important first step in understanding what data is at risk of being stolen or misused. To properly protect your data, you need to know the type of data, where it is, and what it is used for.

The goal is to protect data while providing a functional alternative when needed. | Data masking retains the data type, but changes the values. Data can be modified in a number of ways, including encryption, character shuffling, and character or word substitution.

Only after decrypting the encrypted data using the decryption key, the data can be read or processed. | In public-key cryptography techniques, there is no need to share the decryption key \u2013 the sender and recipient each have their own key, which are combined to perform the encryption operation. This is inherently more secure. | Data encryption can prevent hackers from accessing sensitive information. It is essential for most security strategies and is explicitly required by many compliance standards. | Data Loss Prevention (DLP) | To prevent data loss, organizations can use a number of safeguards, including backing up data to another location.
